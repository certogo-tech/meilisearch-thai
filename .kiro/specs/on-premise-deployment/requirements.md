# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a comprehensive deployment solution for the Thai Tokenizer service to integrate with existing on-premise Meilisearch infrastructure. The deployment will enable seamless Thai text tokenization capabilities while leveraging the existing Meilisearch server, ensuring minimal disruption to current operations and optimal performance for Thai language search functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy the Thai Tokenizer service to our on-premise server, so that I can integrate Thai tokenization capabilities with our existing Meilisearch infrastructure without disrupting current operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment process is initiated THEN the system SHALL create a standalone Thai Tokenizer service that connects to the existing Meilisearch server
2. WHEN the service is deployed THEN it SHALL NOT require modifications to the existing Meilisearch configuration or data
3. WHEN the deployment is complete THEN the Thai Tokenizer service SHALL be accessible via HTTP API endpoints
4. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL automatically verify connectivity to the existing Meilisearch server
5. IF the existing Meilisearch server is unavailable THEN the Thai Tokenizer service SHALL implement graceful degradation and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive deployment documentation and scripts, so that I can deploy and maintain the Thai Tokenizer service efficiently with minimal technical expertise required.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include step-by-step instructions for on-premise deployment
2. WHEN deployment scripts are provided THEN they SHALL automate the installation, configuration, and startup processes
3. WHEN the deployment process runs THEN it SHALL validate system requirements and dependencies before installation
4. WHEN configuration is required THEN the system SHALL provide clear examples for connecting to existing Meilisearch servers
5. WHEN deployment is complete THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints and monitoring capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible deployment options (Docker, systemd service, or standalone), so that I can choose the deployment method that best fits our existing infrastructure and operational practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker deployment is chosen THEN the system SHALL provide Docker containers that can connect to external Meilisearch servers
2. WHEN systemd service deployment is chosen THEN the system SHALL provide service files and installation scripts for Linux systems
3. WHEN standalone deployment is chosen THEN the system SHALL provide Python virtual environment setup with all dependencies
4. WHEN any deployment method is used THEN the service SHALL support the same configuration options and API endpoints
5. WHEN deployment method is selected THEN the system SHALL provide method-specific monitoring and logging configurations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure configuration management, so that I can protect sensitive credentials and ensure the Thai Tokenizer service integrates securely with our existing Meilisearch infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is provided THEN sensitive data (API keys, passwords) SHALL be stored in environment variables or secure configuration files
2. WHEN the service connects to Meilisearch THEN it SHALL support authentication via API keys or other security mechanisms
3. WHEN configuration files are created THEN they SHALL have appropriate file permissions to prevent unauthorized access
4. WHEN the service is deployed THEN it SHALL support SSL/TLS connections to Meilisearch if configured
5. WHEN security is configured THEN the system SHALL provide options for network access control and firewall configuration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want performance optimization and resource management, so that the Thai Tokenizer service operates efficiently within our existing server resources without impacting other services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service is deployed THEN it SHALL allow configuration of memory limits, CPU usage, and worker processes
2. WHEN processing Thai text THEN the service SHALL meet performance targets of <50ms for 1000 characters
3. WHEN multiple requests are received THEN the service SHALL handle concurrent processing efficiently
4. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the service SHALL provide configuration options to optimize for available resources
5. WHEN monitoring is enabled THEN the service SHALL expose metrics for performance tracking and resource usage

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive backup and recovery procedures, so that I can maintain service availability and recover from failures quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backup procedures are provided THEN they SHALL include configuration files, custom dictionaries, and service state
2. WHEN recovery procedures are provided THEN they SHALL enable quick restoration of service functionality
3. WHEN the service fails THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery guidance
4. WHEN updates are applied THEN the system SHALL support rollback to previous versions
5. WHEN maintenance is required THEN the system SHALL provide procedures for graceful service shutdown and restart

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want integration testing and validation tools, so that I can verify the Thai Tokenizer service is working correctly with our existing Meilisearch setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration testing is performed THEN the system SHALL provide test scripts that validate connectivity to existing Meilisearch
2. WHEN validation is run THEN the system SHALL test Thai tokenization accuracy with sample documents
3. WHEN performance testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL verify response times meet specified targets
4. WHEN the service is deployed THEN it SHALL provide health check endpoints for monitoring systems
5. WHEN testing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate reports confirming successful integration
