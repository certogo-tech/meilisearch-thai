# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical issue where Thai-Japanese compound words like "วากาเมะ" (wakame) are incorrectly tokenized into individual syllables instead of being recognized as single semantic units. This causes significant search accuracy problems in MeiliSearch, as users searching for "วากาเมะ" expect to find documents containing "สาหร่ายวากาเมะ" (wakame seaweed), but the current tokenization splits the compound word, making exact matches impossible.

The current tokenizer splits "วากาเมะ" into ["วา", "กา", "เมะ"], which breaks the semantic meaning and reduces search effectiveness for Thai-Japanese food terms, brand names, and technical terminology commonly used in Thai content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Thai content creator, I want compound words like "วากาเมะ" to be tokenized as single units, so that my content can be found when users search for the complete compound word.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tokenizer processes "สาหร่ายวากาเมะ" THEN the system SHALL produce tokens ["สาหร่าย", "วากาเมะ"]
2. WHEN the tokenizer processes "วากาเมะ" in isolation THEN the system SHALL produce token ["วากาเมะ"]
3. WHEN the tokenizer processes compound words in context THEN the system SHALL maintain compound word integrity while properly segmenting surrounding Thai text

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a search user, I want to find documents containing compound words when I search for the complete compound term, so that I get accurate and relevant search results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for "วากาเมะ" THEN MeiliSearch SHALL return documents containing "สาหร่ายวากาเมะ"
2. WHEN a user searches for "สาหร่ายวากาเมะ" THEN MeiliSearch SHALL return exact matches with high relevance scores
3. WHEN a user searches for partial compound words THEN the system SHALL provide fallback results while prioritizing complete compound matches

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the compound word recognition to be configurable and extensible, so that I can add new compound words without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new compound words are added to the configuration THEN the tokenizer SHALL recognize them without requiring code deployment
2. WHEN compound word rules are updated THEN the system SHALL reload the configuration without service restart
3. WHEN compound word recognition fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to standard tokenization gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want compound word tokenization to maintain performance standards, so that the improved accuracy doesn't compromise system responsiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing compound words THEN tokenization time SHALL remain under 50ms for 1000 characters
2. WHEN compound word recognition is enabled THEN memory usage SHALL not exceed 256MB per container
3. WHEN processing mixed content THEN the system SHALL maintain throughput of 500+ documents per second

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want the system to handle various types of compound words, so that all Thai-foreign language combinations work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing Thai-Japanese compounds THEN the system SHALL recognize food terms, brand names, and technical terms
2. WHEN processing Thai-English compounds THEN the system SHALL apply similar compound recognition logic
3. WHEN processing compound words with tone marks and special characters THEN the system SHALL preserve character integrity
4. WHEN processing compound words in different contexts THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across document types
