# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a web-based administrative interface for managing Thai compound words in the tokenizer system. Currently, compound words must be manually edited in JSON files, which is error-prone and requires technical knowledge. The admin frontend will allow non-technical users to easily add, edit, and test compound words through an intuitive web interface, with real-time tokenization testing and validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content administrator, I want a web interface to manage compound words, so that I can add new Thai-Japanese terms without editing JSON files directly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the admin interface THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard with current compound word statistics
2. WHEN I view the compound dictionary THEN the system SHALL show all words organized by category (Thai-Japanese, Thai-English, etc.)
3. WHEN I add a new compound word THEN the system SHALL validate the word and update the dictionary immediately
4. WHEN I delete a compound word THEN the system SHALL remove it from the dictionary and confirm the action

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a linguist, I want to test compound word tokenization in real-time, so that I can verify new words work correctly before saving them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter text in the test interface THEN the system SHALL show tokenization results in real-time
2. WHEN I add a new compound word THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect the change in test results
3. WHEN I test different text samples THEN the system SHALL highlight compound words that were preserved
4. WHEN tokenization fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and fallback results

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor compound word usage and performance, so that I can optimize the dictionary for better search results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view analytics THEN the system SHALL show compound word usage statistics from API logs
2. WHEN I review performance metrics THEN the system SHALL display tokenization speed and accuracy data
3. WHEN compound words cause issues THEN the system SHALL alert me with detailed error information
4. WHEN I export data THEN the system SHALL provide dictionary backups and usage reports

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to integrate seamlessly with the existing API, so that changes are immediately available to all tokenizer instances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dictionary changes are made THEN the system SHALL update all running tokenizer instances without restart
2. WHEN the API is unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry mechanisms
3. WHEN multiple users edit simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully with proper locking
4. WHEN changes are saved THEN the system SHALL validate them against the API before committing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want to bulk import and validate compound words, so that I can efficiently manage large dictionaries from external sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload a CSV or JSON file THEN the system SHALL validate all entries and show import preview
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic entries with specific error messages
3. WHEN I confirm bulk import THEN the system SHALL add valid entries and report any skipped items
4. WHEN I export the dictionary THEN the system SHALL provide multiple formats (JSON, CSV, Excel) for external use
