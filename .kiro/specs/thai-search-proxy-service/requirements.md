# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Thai Search Proxy Service is an intelligent search intermediary that enhances Thai language search capabilities by providing advanced tokenization and ranking services. The service acts as a proxy between frontend applications and Meilisearch, automatically processing raw search keywords through Thai NLP tokenization, performing searches with both original and tokenized terms, and returning optimally ranked results to improve search accuracy for Thai content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to send raw Thai search keywords to a single API endpoint, so that I can get intelligently processed and ranked search results without handling Thai tokenization complexity myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a frontend application sends a search request with raw Thai keywords THEN the service SHALL accept the request via a RESTful API endpoint
2. WHEN the service receives search keywords THEN it SHALL preserve the original query for fallback purposes
3. WHEN processing the request THEN the service SHALL return results in a consistent JSON format within 100ms for typical requests
4. IF the request contains invalid parameters THEN the service SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes with descriptive messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a search user, I want my Thai search queries to be automatically tokenized using advanced NLP techniques, so that I can find relevant content even when using compound words or informal language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service receives Thai text THEN it SHALL tokenize the text using PyThaiNLP as the primary tokenization engine
2. WHEN PyThaiNLP tokenization fails THEN the service SHALL fall back to attacut or deepcut tokenization methods
3. WHEN all advanced tokenization methods fail THEN the service SHALL fall back to basic character-level segmentation
4. WHEN processing mixed Thai-English content THEN the service SHALL handle both languages appropriately
5. WHEN tokenizing text THEN the service SHALL complete tokenization within 50ms for 1000 Thai characters

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a search user, I want the service to search Meilisearch with both my original keywords and tokenized versions, so that I get comprehensive search results that account for different word segmentation possibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tokenization is complete THEN the service SHALL perform searches in Meilisearch using both original and tokenized keywords
2. WHEN searching Meilisearch THEN the service SHALL configure appropriate Thai-specific search settings
3. WHEN multiple search variants are used THEN the service SHALL collect all unique results from different search approaches
4. IF Meilisearch is unavailable THEN the service SHALL return an appropriate error response with retry suggestions
5. WHEN communicating with Meilisearch THEN the service SHALL handle timeouts and connection errors gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a search user, I want search results to be intelligently ranked based on relevance to both my original query and tokenized terms, so that the most relevant content appears first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple search results are retrieved THEN the service SHALL rank results based on relevance scoring algorithms
2. WHEN ranking results THEN the service SHALL consider matches against both original and tokenized query terms
3. WHEN calculating relevance scores THEN the service SHALL prioritize exact matches over partial matches
4. WHEN results have similar relevance scores THEN the service SHALL apply consistent tie-breaking rules
5. WHEN returning results THEN the service SHALL include relevance scores in the response for transparency

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the service to provide health monitoring and performance metrics, so that I can ensure the service is operating correctly and meeting performance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service is running THEN it SHALL provide a health check endpoint that verifies connectivity to Meilisearch
2. WHEN health checks are performed THEN the service SHALL verify that Thai tokenization libraries are functioning correctly
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the service SHALL log performance metrics including tokenization time and search duration
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the service SHALL log structured error information without exposing sensitive user data
5. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL complete initialization within 2 seconds including dependency verification

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the service, I want comprehensive API documentation and consistent error handling, so that I can easily implement and troubleshoot integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API errors occur THEN the service SHALL return consistent JSON error responses with error codes and descriptions
2. WHEN the service is deployed THEN it SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
3. WHEN handling Thai text THEN the service SHALL use UTF-8 encoding consistently throughout the system
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the service SHALL validate input parameters and return clear validation error messages
5. WHEN the API evolves THEN the service SHALL maintain backward compatibility through versioned endpoints

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the service to handle high concurrent loads efficiently, so that multiple users can search simultaneously without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple concurrent requests are received THEN the service SHALL process them asynchronously using async/await patterns
2. WHEN under load THEN the service SHALL maintain response times under 100ms for 95% of requests
3. WHEN processing batch requests THEN the service SHALL support bulk document processing at >500 documents/second
4. WHEN memory usage increases THEN the service SHALL maintain usage under 256MB per container instance
5. WHEN connection pools are used THEN the service SHALL implement proper connection management for external services
