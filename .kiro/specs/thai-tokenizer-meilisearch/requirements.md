# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses MeiliSearch's limitation in searching Thai compound words by implementing a custom Thai tokenizer. Thai language has unique characteristics where words are written without spaces, making it challenging for standard tokenizers to properly segment compound words for search indexing. This solution will integrate a Thai-specific tokenization approach with MeiliSearch to improve search accuracy for Thai text content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using MeiliSearch with Thai content, I want the search engine to properly tokenize Thai compound words, so that users can find relevant documents even when searching with partial compound words.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Thai text containing compound words is indexed THEN the system SHALL properly segment the text into meaningful word components
2. WHEN a user searches for a partial compound word THEN the system SHALL return documents containing the full compound word
3. WHEN Thai text is processed THEN the tokenizer SHALL handle both simple words and complex compound structures
4. WHEN indexing occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve original text while creating searchable tokens

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy the Thai tokenizer as a containerized solution, so that it can be easily integrated with existing MeiliSearch deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tokenizer is deployed THEN it SHALL run in a Docker container alongside MeiliSearch
2. WHEN the container starts THEN it SHALL automatically configure the Thai tokenizer with MeiliSearch
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL provide clear documentation for setup and configuration
4. WHEN the container runs THEN it SHALL maintain performance comparable to standard MeiliSearch operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the Thai tokenizer with sample data, so that I can verify it correctly handles various Thai text patterns and compound word scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sample Thai text is provided THEN the system SHALL demonstrate proper tokenization of compound words
2. WHEN test queries are executed THEN the system SHALL show improved search results compared to default tokenization
3. WHEN testing occurs THEN the system SHALL provide before/after comparisons of search capabilities
4. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL include test cases for common Thai compound word patterns
5. WHEN performance testing occurs THEN the system SHALL measure and report tokenization speed and accuracy

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want the Thai tokenizer to handle different types of Thai text content, so that search works effectively across various document types and writing styles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing formal Thai text THEN the system SHALL correctly tokenize academic and business terminology
2. WHEN processing informal Thai text THEN the system SHALL handle colloquial expressions and modern compound words
3. WHEN processing mixed content THEN the system SHALL properly handle Thai text mixed with English or numbers
4. WHEN encountering unknown words THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle them without breaking the tokenization process

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear integration APIs and configuration options, so that I can customize the Thai tokenizer behavior for specific use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating the tokenizer THEN the system SHALL provide clear API endpoints for configuration
2. WHEN customization is needed THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of tokenization parameters
3. WHEN monitoring is required THEN the system SHALL provide logging and metrics for tokenization operations
4. WHEN troubleshooting occurs THEN the system SHALL offer diagnostic tools to analyze tokenization results
