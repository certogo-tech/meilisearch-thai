# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a web-based administrative interface for managing Thai compound words in the tokenizer system. Currently, compound words must be manually edited in JSON files, which is error-prone and requires technical knowledge. The admin frontend will allow non-technical users to easily add, edit, and test compound words through an intuitive web interface, with real-time tokenization testing and validation.

The system will integrate seamlessly with the existing Thai tokenizer API and provide immediate feedback on compound word effectiveness, usage analytics, and bulk management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content administrator, I want a web interface to manage compound words, so that I can add new Thai-Japanese terms without editing JSON files directly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the admin interface THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard with current compound word statistics
2. WHEN I view the compound dictionary THEN the system SHALL show all words organized by category with search and filtering capabilities
3. WHEN I add a new compound word THEN the system SHALL validate the word format and update the dictionary immediately
4. WHEN I edit an existing compound word THEN the system SHALL preserve the edit history and update usage statistics
5. WHEN I delete a compound word THEN the system SHALL confirm the action and remove it from all tokenizer instances

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a linguist, I want to test compound word tokenization in real-time, so that I can verify new words work correctly before saving them to the production dictionary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter text in the test interface THEN the system SHALL show tokenization results in real-time with visual highlighting
2. WHEN I add a new compound word THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect the change in test results without page refresh
3. WHEN I test different text samples THEN the system SHALL highlight compound words that were preserved as single tokens
4. WHEN tokenization fails or produces unexpected results THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and fallback behavior
5. WHEN I compare before/after tokenization THEN the system SHALL show side-by-side results with difference highlighting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor compound word usage and performance, so that I can optimize the dictionary for better search results and system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view analytics THEN the system SHALL show compound word usage statistics from API request logs
2. WHEN I review performance metrics THEN the system SHALL display tokenization speed, accuracy, and error rates over time
3. WHEN compound words cause performance issues THEN the system SHALL alert me with detailed error information and suggested fixes
4. WHEN I export analytics data THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive reports in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, PDF)
5. WHEN I monitor system health THEN the system SHALL show real-time status of all tokenizer instances and dictionary synchronization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to integrate seamlessly with the existing API, so that changes are immediately available to all tokenizer instances without service disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dictionary changes are made THEN the system SHALL update all running tokenizer instances using hot-reload without restart
2. WHEN the API is unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL display appropriate error messages and provide retry mechanisms
3. WHEN multiple users edit simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully with proper locking and merge resolution
4. WHEN changes are saved THEN the system SHALL validate them against the API schema before committing to prevent data corruption
5. WHEN API responses are slow THEN the system SHALL provide loading indicators and timeout handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want to bulk import and validate compound words, so that I can efficiently manage large dictionaries from external sources and linguistic databases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload a CSV, JSON, or Excel file THEN the system SHALL validate all entries and show a detailed import preview
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic entries with specific error messages and correction suggestions
3. WHEN I confirm bulk import THEN the system SHALL add valid entries, report skipped items, and provide a detailed import summary
4. WHEN I export the dictionary THEN the system SHALL provide multiple formats with filtering options and metadata inclusion
5. WHEN I schedule automated imports THEN the system SHALL process files from configured sources and send notification reports

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want role-based access control for the admin interface, so that I can ensure only authorized users can modify the compound dictionary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the interface THEN the system SHALL require authentication with secure session management
2. WHEN I assign user roles THEN the system SHALL enforce permissions (Admin, Editor, Viewer) for different interface sections
3. WHEN administrative actions are performed THEN the system SHALL log all changes with user identification and timestamps
4. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL block the action and alert administrators
5. WHEN user sessions expire THEN the system SHALL automatically log out users and require re-authentication

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the admin interface to work on tablets and mobile devices, so that I can manage compound words while away from my desktop computer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the interface on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive design that adapts to screen size
2. WHEN I use touch interactions THEN the system SHALL support touch gestures for navigation and editing
3. WHEN I work offline temporarily THEN the system SHALL cache data and sync changes when connectivity is restored
4. WHEN I use the interface on slow connections THEN the system SHALL optimize data loading and provide progressive enhancement
5. WHEN I switch between devices THEN the system SHALL maintain session state and unsaved changes across devices
